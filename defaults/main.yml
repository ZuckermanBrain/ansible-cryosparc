# defaults file for app-cryosparc
# Acceptable roles include "master", "worker", and "cluster".  
# If using "cluster", then you must also use "worker" and the
# crysoparc_cluster variable should be toggled to True.

# Boolean variable to indicate if there is a cluster.
# This is necessary because the CryoSparc cluster configuration
# requires non-standard actions on both the master node and a worker node within the cluster.
# Namely, a cluster worker does not register with the master and the master must
# execute a command on its end to register the cluster.
